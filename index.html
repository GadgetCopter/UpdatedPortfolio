      Hey! My name is Rich Dobrzeniecki and I am a glass-blower turned web developer.
      I am orginally from Cleveland, OH, but I have lived everywhere from South Carolina to Washington State.
      Before web-development I was a full-time glass-blower living and working in Seattle, WA, and I still love
      to make glass when I get the chance. Besides development and glass, I love my cats (the one in the picture is named Yokai), 
      esports and a good times with friends.
    </div> 
    <div class="about-me2">
      I recently moved back home to Cleveland, OH to attend the coding bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University, with hopes
      to transition into a full-time developer. I'm super excited to see where this road takes me!
